# DIABETES-PREDICTION-USING-COMBINATION-OF-ML-ALGORITHMS
Diabetes Project using ensemble method , in addition to Cassandra and flask
This is the Diabetes prediction using  combination of Machine Languages :

Here we have taken dataset from Kaggle, the dataset name called pima dataset. Here we have used 4 ML algorithms, the algorithms are SVM,RF,DT and ANN.

We have taken RF as the best model.

We are importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset then we split into training and testing data.

Then we go for the feature selection.

Then we go for the ml model with voting classifier.

Then we go for the accuracy.


FRONTEND :

We have used the flask to connect the frontend.

We have used the Html and CSS to design it interactively.

BACKEND :

We have used the  Apache Cassandra DB to store the data in Database.

It’s best than the non sql , because its performance is higher than the sql. 
When the dates high , It can manage it.


Visualisation of Data :

We have used Jupyter notebook for this .

We have used Pycharm for this.
